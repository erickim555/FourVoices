'''Thread-safe version of Tkinter.

Usage:

    import mtTkinter as Tkinter
    # Use "Tkinter." as usual.

or

    from mtTkinter import *
    # Use Tkinter module definitions as usual.

This module modifies the original Tkinter module in memory, making all
functionality thread-safe. It does this by wrapping the Tk class' tk
instance with an object that diverts calls through an event queue when
the call is issued from a thread other than the thread in which the Tk
instance was created. The events are processed in the creation thread
via an 'after' event.

The modified Tk class accepts two additional keyword parameters on its
__init__ method:
    mtDebug:
        0 = No debug output (default)
        1 = Minimal debug output
        ...
        9 = Full debug output
    mtCheckPeriod:
        Amount of time in milliseconds (default 100) between checks for
        out-of-thread events when things are otherwise idle. Decreasing
        this value can improve GUI responsiveness, but at the expense of
        consuming more CPU cycles.

Note that, because it modifies the original Tkinter module (in memory),
other modules that use Tkinter (e.g., Pmw) reap the benefits automagically
as long as mtTkinter is imported at some point before extra threads are
created.

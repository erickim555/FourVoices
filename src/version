Four-Part Harmony Solver!

===== Version 0.1
Thursday, January 14th, 2010
4:00 PM

- Initial "release"
- (Hopefully) runnable on any platform

===== Version 0.2
Thursday, January 14th, 2010
7:25 PM
- Fixed bug that prevented it from running on systems without Abjad installed (whoops)

===== Version 0.21
Saturday, January 16th, 2010
3:42 PM - ?
- Re-did some of the visuals to make it less appalling!
- Added a constraint that prevents the seventh being doubled in a voicing

===== Version 0.22
- Fixed dim7 (the seventh was NOT a diminished seventh, it was a minor seventh, whoops)
- Fixed dominant diminished chord resolutions (i.e don't double root of vii, the fifth should resolve down)
- Fixed a bug where Delete-Everything will keep your 'time-cursor' at where it used to be - annoying when you
    then went to add a new chord, only to find it was default-set to time, say, 5 (instead of 0).
- Added rudimentary play-back support! (courtesy of mxm [http://www.mxm.dk/products/public/pythonmidi] and pygame)
- Added threading support for the solver, in addition to interrupt-behavior for the solver.
- Fixed solver for proper removal handling...(seemed to not be deleting chords/notes correctly)
- Fixed bug: delete_all_notes doesn't remove the constraint from the problem! 

===== Version 0.23
3-28-2012
- Initial "release" to github project: 
    "FourVoices" (https://github.com/erickim555/FourVoices)
- Seems stable (on Windows 7 at least), able to harmonize progressions
  correctly. Not bad for a code base that hasn't been touched since 
  July, 2012! :P

TO-DO: File I/O (it'd be nice to be able to save/load previous problem setups / solutions)
TO-DO: Better GUI!
TO-DO: Clean up code base (it's public now, gasp!), remove undesirable
       dependencies (such as pygame).

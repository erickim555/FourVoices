- Chords with GUI vs core/solver.py
    Currently, UI incrementally updates HarmonySolver.chords whenever
    the user creates a new chord.
    However, adding a new figure (ie voice notes) to UI only updates
    UI's data structs - when user clicks solve, then all notes are
    added to HarmonySolver.figures(), and the problem is solved.
    It'd be best if the same behavior is used for chords too.

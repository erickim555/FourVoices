# This is a template file outlining how input files to the command
# line interface should look like.
# Comments are signaled by a '#' at the beginning of the line (and
# ONLY at the start of the line)

# Each Problem file is broken up in two sections: Chords, and Lines.
#
# The 'Chords' section is signalled by the line:
#     [Chords]  
# This section is csv-style, with columns:
#     int time, str root, str role, str modifier0, str modifier1, ...
# where:
#     int TIME: Which time position this row defines
#     str ROOT: The root note of this chord. Can be None.
#     str ROLE: The harmonic role (function) of this chord. Can be
#               one of:
#                   tonic
#                   subdominant
#                   dominant
#                   None
#     str BASSNOTE: Can be a note, or None.
#     str MODIFIERS: Can be: major, minor, 7, maj7, min7, dim, dim7, None.
# For instance, here's a simple ii-V-I instance:

[Chords]
# time, root, role, bassnote, modifiers...
0, D, subdominant, None, minor
1, G, dominant, B2, 7
2, C, tonic, C3, major

# The 'Lines' section is signalled by the line:
#     [Lines]
# Here, specific notes can be specified. For instance, if you want the
# soprano voice to follow a particular melody, that melody can be
# inputted here.
